### Simulating Throws ###
 Hi, Im currently learning the basics of coding by working through the Book 'How to Design Programs: An Introduction to Programming and Computing, 2nd Edition' by MIT Press.

In this project I am simulating physical events.

Projectile Motion is the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air, subject to only the acceleration of gravity.
